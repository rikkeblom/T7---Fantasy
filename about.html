        <h1 class="abouttitle">Welcome to our Character Generator</h1>
        <h4>
          If you are seeking fantastical inspiration, our generator will come
          with great haste to your aide.
        </h4>

        <h3>What can character-creation be used for?</h3>
        <p>
          The characters can be used in fantasy role-play gaming (such as
          Dungeons and Dragons) or to use in writing or visual art.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the ethos behind the site?</h3>
        <p>
          This site is a free resource for all who want to escape into other
          realms. We are very much copy-left and our fantasy-genre-related
          advertising is used sparingly.
        </p>
        <h3>Who are the makers of this site?</h3>
        <p>
          We are four students in Multimedia Design and this is a project that
          was set on the topic of shared interest. We chose to make a site based
          on the fantasy genre - because each of us either role-plays, reads,
          writes or creates art based on fantasy-concepts and world-building.
